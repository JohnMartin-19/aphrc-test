I have been able to tackle the challenge. These are the tools that I have used:
Frontend:
React JS
I have written my frontend code in the frontend directory, and the application is run by:
cd into the src dir and run:
npm start

Backend: 
FAST API
The backend is majorly powered by web sockets.
Notable dependencies include:
fastapi & uvicorn
latest pip version
virtual env
To run the backend, cd into the backend dir
run:
source venv/bin/activate   to activate the venv
the run:
uvicorn main:app --reload
